# FDS-PineScriptUltimate
All in One Pine Script For Use at STOCK Markets and Crypto Markets

The script provides a visual representation of the trend of a financial asset, such as a stock or currency, over a specified period of time. The trend is represented by a series of candles, where each candle represents a certain period of time, such as a day or an hour.

The color of each candle provides information about the direction of the trend. If the closing price of the asset is higher than the opening price, the candle is displayed in green. If the closing price is lower than the opening price, the candle is displayed in red.

The darkness of the green or red color represents the strength of the trend. Dark Green candles indicate a strong bullish trend, meaning that the asset price has been rising steadily. Light Green candles, on the other hand, indicate a weak bullish trend, meaning that the price has only slightly risen or is showing some volatility.

Similarly, Dark Red candles indicate a strong bearish trend, meaning that the asset price has been falling steadily. Light Red candles indicate a weak bearish trend, meaning that the price has only slightly fallen or is showing some volatility.
